# Data, Code and Tutorial about the DH&HML package
The package contains the data and models developed as descriptored in the paper _Metals with full d-orbitals promote of methyl cyclohexane dehydrogenation found via physics-inspired machine learning_ by C. Lin and T. Choksi et al.

This package is designed to screen catalysts for dehydrogenation or hydrogenation reactions. The example shown in the tutorial is the dehydrogenation reaction of methyl cyclohexane (CH3-C6H11) forming toluene (CH3-C6H5) and hydrogen.

The DH&HML package contains two folders, one tutorial video and one tutorial slide. Please refer to the tutorial files to learn how to use this package.

Enjoy exploring the catalyst!
