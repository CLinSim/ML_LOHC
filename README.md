# Data, Code and Tutorial about the DH&HML package
The package contains the data and models used in the paper _Harnessing Physics-inspired Machine Learning to Design Nanocluster Catalysts for Dehydrogenating Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers_ by C. Lin and T. Choksi et al.

This package is designed to screen catalysts for dehydrogenation or hydrogenation reactions. The example shown in the tutorial is the dehydrogenation reaction of methyl cyclohexane (CH3-C6H11) forming toluene (CH3-C6H5) and hydrogen.

The DH&HML package contains two folders and one tutorial slide.

Enjoy exploring the catalyst!
